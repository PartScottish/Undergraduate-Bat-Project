Title: Plasticity of sonal design by Pipistrellus pygmaeus in cluttered, edge and open space habitats.

Description: Placing over-night (three repetitions) recording devices in three habitats to capture bat calls. The goal was to identify bat calls in each habitat and identify the species distribution across them. Then we would look at the sonal design of each species and explain the fundamental diffrences between them, identify their efficacy in their given preferred habitat and comment on the sonal plasticity of those that were multi-habitat hunters.

Contents: Written report. NOTE* There is (sadly) no code repo for the stats work on the results for this project. This also included a short essay at the end titled: "How echolocation call structure and wing morphology relate to the ecology of the European myotis bats." designed to demonstrate and consncise understanding to a high academic level of the subject matter.
